Functions
-----------

* start with def
* no return type - either what return statement returns or None. (not last statement stuff)
* args have  no type either.
* function are objects too..
* invoked with fnName(args) [dont forget parenthesis for empty-arg fns]

eg:

def add(a,b):
  c=a+b
  return c

add(5,10)


Commenting comments
-------------------

* '''...''' right after the function defintion
* function.__doc__ is the way to get the doc-string of a function
* Simple comments begin with #

Data-types
===========

booleans
numbers
strings
bytes and bytearray
lists
tuples
sets
dictionaries

* use type(variable) to check the type of a variable.

List
----

* list is [ .. ] separated by comma
* list elements are indexed from 0 and name[0] is the way to get one element
* -1 is the last element.
* slicing is first index to *one before* the second index.
* slicing generally creates a reference to a list. However, in the a[:] form,
  Slicing creates a copy, so a[:] is a shorthand for getting a copy of a list
* l[:size] -> will give u first size elements
* l[size:] -> will give u from size'th index (i.e size+1th element) till end
* lists never have gaps

len(a)
a.append(one_value)
a.extend([list])
a.insert(index,value)  # Use this for inserting at head/index-0 !
del a[index]   # list size reduced by one. and all indices index+1:<end> .. become index:<end>
a.pop()  # pops the last index, gets a IndexError when we pop a empty list. List reduces after pop.
a.pop(index)  # pops given index
a.remove(value)  # pops vlaue. raises ValueError if value is not found
a.index(value)  # gives index of the value.
sorted(a)   # Gives a new list which is sorted a.
str.join(a)  # joins each element in a with str as the joining character .. eg: '\n'.join(a)

value in a # boolean expression to check if value is in a list. WORKS FOR STRING AS WELL

for value in a:
  # .. use value

+ operator concatenates lists

list.sort()  -> sorts the list in place. So better than sorted(list) if u dont need orig-list.
             -> sorted() takes any iterable, but list.sort() is available only for lists.
Both sorted and list.sort() take a named key arg. This is a function with one-arg and returns
         a value, which is used as the value to be sorted. (Efficient as this func is called 
         only once for each member). Lambda's are typically used here..


Tuples
-----

* Use ( , .. , ) for types instead of squarebracket.
* (tuple1) = (tuple2)
    eg: (x,y,z) = (1,2,3) is a conveneient way to assign multiple variables respectively


Sets
-----

* Use { , .. , } for sets
* sets dont remember order of their elements
* values in the sets are unique.

a.add(value)  # adds a value to set if its not already present.
a.update(value, set, list) # addes the value, members of set, list to the set.
a.discard(value)  # removes the value from set. No error if value not present
a.remove(value)  # removes the value from set. KeyError is raised if value not present.
a.pop()          # removes some arbitrary member from set. KeyError on empty set
a.clear()         # clears the set. same as a=set()

a.union(b)  # returns a *new* set that is union of a & b
a.intersection(b)
a.difference(b)             # in a not in b
a.symmetric_difference(b)   # in strictly only of a and b

Note: a= {} creates a empty *dictionary*, not set.

Dictionary
------------

* user { key:value } for dictionary

a[key] = value  # for assignment or referenence. Note they key is indexed using squre braket only!

a.keys()    # gives a list of keys of dictionary a, not necesarily in sorted order .. probably iterable in py-3
a.vaues()   # gives a list of values
a.items()   # gives a list of tuple of (key, value) from a dictionary

orig_dict.update(another_dict)

List comprehesion
------------------

[ expression-having-variable for variable in origList ]
[ expression-having-variable for variable in origList if condition ]

so is it with dictionary and set comprehesion

{ expression_with_i:another_expression_with_i for i in a_list if condition }


strings
---------

* Every string is a UTF-8 encoded sequence of characters in python-3.
* strings can be single or double-quoted(abs no diff. This helps to avoid escaping either). Triple single quotes is for long strings. r'raw \.string' is a raw strings
* + is a way to concatenate strings

a.splitlines()       # list of lines. The restult wont have carriage returns.
a.lower()            # returns a new string that has all lower caps
a.upper()
a.count('f')         # counts no of substrings
a.split(delimiter,times)   # splits a string based on delimiter. THe second is optional and gives number of times the slice should be done.

a.encode('utf-8')    # gives a bytes object

a.index()
haystack.find(needle [,start [,end]])  # give index in haystack where needle is found, -1 on failure, start:end as in slicing
a.replace()

a.strip()            # trim whitespaces
a.rstrip()
a.lstrip()

ord(a)    # gives the ordinal value of a, give just one char as input
chr(num)  # inverse of ord

bytes
-----

defined as b'\xfe' or b'abc'

a=b'\x65\x48'        # a bytes object
a.decode('ascii')    # gives a string object. 
                     # encode/decode complement bytes/str conversion

bytes like string is immutable
bytearray is mutuable

control structures
------------------

if condition:
  ...
elif next_condition:         #python's else if style
  ..
else
  ..

with lists.
  Use range function to run over a range.
  range(start-value, end-value+1, increment)

for i in list:
  ..use i..

for i in range(1,10):
  ..use i..

break
continue

Want to iterate over 2(or more) lists of the same length simulataneously?
 -> Keep them as one list of tuples!
eg:
student=['s1','s2','s3']
mentor=['m1',m2','m3]
count = 0
for s in student:
  print s,m[0]

can instead be:

student_mentors=[('s1','m1'),('s2','m2'),('s3','m3')]
for (s,m) in student_mentors:
  print s,m



logical operators
-----------------

and
or
not


variable args to function
-------------------------

def manyArgs(arg1, arg2, *args, **kwargs):
  #arg1, arg2 are std args
  #args is a tuple of all unnamed args
  #kwargs is a dict of all named args



class
-----

class Name:
  #There is no explicity declaring of members

  count = 0                     # Can be used like static in c++, but see notes below

  def __init__(self,arg1,arg2):
    self.member1=arg1           #automaticaly adds member1 as a field to the class objects.

  def function(self,arg1):
    pass                        #all member function's first arg is self.
    Name.count++;               #refering a Name.member brings in a c++-style static member of the class.

  @staticmethod
  def function(arg1):
    pass                        # note the absence of self for member functions
    Name.count++;               #refering a Name.member brings in a c++-style static member of the class.


#Later..
n = Name(10,12)

* The attributes of a class are kind of public. No data-encapsulation.
* In fact, attributes of a class can be added at will anytime. There is really no
  fixed-set of attributes for a class
  n.newAttribute = "abc"   # is perfectly valid anywhere!
* ClassName.var_name  # when used with ClassName refers to a var_name in class-scope(static like)
                      # DONT FORGET the ClassName - otherwise, it just uses/refers to a local var.
* methods in the class can work on static members as long as they use ClassName to scope it.
* But instance_var.var_name  # when assigned to, will create a instance level attribute!



Magic attributes of a class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

n.__class__    # reference to a object of type class, which represents the class-definition
n.__doc__      # reference to the doc-string
n.__repr__     # is a function, that will used to stringize the class. 
               # Tip, it takes mandorty self, u can actaully pass more args
               # as long as u have default-args.

lambda
-------

lambda arg1 [, arg2,..]: manipulate(args)

map
---

Gives a generator, where the given fn is applied on the list provided.

map (fn_to_apply, list_of_inputs)

Iterators
---------

* A class that implements __iter__ , which returns a object that implements __next__
* Typically its customary to return self in __iter__ and implemen __next__
* User calls next() and gets StopIteration error at end.


Generator
---------

* Is a function (defined with def Name():)
* But has a yield statement in it.
* You have to first create a object by calling generate_name() [read, generate_name param param]
* Later you call gentr.next() to start getting values out of it.
* When its done, you get StopIteration thrown (This happens when generator code falls off its def block)
* On actual invocation (creation of object), no code gets executed.
* On first next, code gets executed till yield which is returned outside
* On susequent next()'s, code continues from yield till yield is hit again. Note taht all vars in
  the def block remember their values
* When code falls off the def-block, we get StopIteration thrown to the next() caller.

Generator expressions
---------------------

* syntactically different form Comprehension with a parenthesis!
* Generators are cheaper than comprehension as the list isn't created right away

(expression for i in origList)

closures
----------

* A (typically anonymous) function that takes arguments (like normal function) and has a state inside it.
* The state is set up in the closure at the time of its creation.
* The closure can mutate its state during every invocation
* Multiple instances of the same closure function can have different states.
* At the outset, you will see a function having a inner function, and returning the inner function

A closure is typically created like this

def create_a_closure(state1_for_closure):
  state2_for_closure = "some_initial_value"
  def my_closure(closure_arg1, closure_arg2):
    result = work_on(state1_for_closure, state2_for_closure, closure_arg1, closure_arg2)
    state1_for_closure = "new_values"  # Note this state was setup at closure create time (call of create_a_closure)
    state2_for_closure = "new_values"  # Note this state was setup at coding time
    return result
  return my_closure

#Later
a_closure = create_a_closure("intial_value_for_state1")

decorators
-----------

* The intent of a decorator is to wrap around any function with added behavior
* You write a closure like situation, where a function takes one function as arg, which defines a inner funciton and returns it.
* The inner funciton does fancy stuff (and calling the actual supplied function)
* Later you can just use the decorator syntax 
@decorator_name
def function_that_will_be_wrapped(...):
  ...

* Users just invoke normally with function_that_will_be_wrapped() and that gets wrapped by the decorator

itertools
----------

itertools.permutations(iterable, size_to_work)
itertools.combinations(iterable, size_to_work)
itertools.product(iterable, iterable)           -> (1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,a), (2,b), (2,c)
itertools.groupby(iterable,keyfunc)             -> listof (keyvalue, sub-iterators) Note: given iterable Must be already sorted/sub-sorted.
itertools.chain(it1,it2,..itn)                  -> single iterator that goes over all
itertools.zip(it1,it2,..itn)                    -> single iterator that goes over tuples of members of all iterables. Stops at shorted.
itertools.zip_longest(it1,it2,..itn)            -> ..zip till longes, filling None for thse that are over.

Simple commands
----------------

print()   # also prints a "\n" at end of string

print "happy arg:%d"%arg,  # the trailing comman skips the newline

print('.',end="",flush=True)   # to control "\n" and flushing  .. only in python 3
sys.stdout.flush()  # in python 2

print('string',file=sys.stdout)  # to a file

string.format(args)
'{0} {1:2d}'.format(s,i)

{arg-position:<width><type>}  # default type is string

older pythong:

# use this and use print statement.
from __future__ import print_function

print "format string %d, %s, %s"%(int_var,str_var,"string literal")


Error handling/Exception
--------------

try:

except IOError:

# Note its except and not expect

* No one defines what exceptions will be raised. We handle every possible exception
* keyword to throw in python is raise

def function():
  ...;
  if problem:
    raise IOError;
  ...;


Various ways to catch exceptions:

except IOError as e:
  e.whatever..
  e.errno
  e.strerror

Capture all Exceptions!

except Exception,e:
  print str(e)



Reading file line by line:
--------------------------


with open("file","r") as fp:
  for i in fp:                  # This is efficient on large files. so *ok for big files*
    print(i)

with open("file","r") as fp, open("second-file","r") as fp2:   # for multiple files

f.readlines()   # gives each line of file in a list.. Note: Entire file is gobbled in one-go. Useful *only for small files.*
f.read()        # gets entire file as one big string. Again, use for small files only.

Reading line by line from stdin:

import fileinput
for line in fileinput.input():   #this one will pick stdin or if some arg(s) is/are given, it will open that as a file!
  pass

import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
  print line

for line_number, line in enumerate(fd):   # will also get line-number along

User input (from stdin, keyboard)
----------

variable=input("Prompt string w/o newline:")     # Gets user-input and interprets it as a python-expression! Thus unquoted string-literals are interpreted as var-names
                                                 # Most likely not what you want. But if you type in a int, your variable also holds a int-object directly.
variable=raw_input("Prompt string w/o newline:") # Gets whatever is given and assigns to variable which is now a str. You then cast this string into whatever you want.

Use readline library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import readline
def rlinput(prompt, prefill=''):
  readline.set_startup_hook(lambda: readline.insert_text(prefill))
  try:
    return raw_input(prompt)
  finally:
    readline.set_startup_hook()

Arg parse
--------

import argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-v","--verbose", help="increase output verbosity", action="store_true")       # captures if --verbosity present or not in arg-list. No arg per-se for this option.
parser.add_argument("-v","--verbose", help="increase output verbosity", action="count")            # captures how many times --verbosity was present in arg-list. No arg per-se for this option.
parser.add_argument("-v","--verbose", help="increase output verbosity", type=int)                  # --verbosity <int>
parser.add_argument("-v","--verbose", help="increase output verbosity", type=int, choices=[0,1,2]) # --verbosity <0|1|2>
parser.add_argument("square",   help="display a square of a given number (this is a mandatory argment)", type=int)
parser.add_argument("optional", help="User may skip this", nargs="?", default="abc")
parser.add_argument("many_optional", help="User may give zero or  more of this and this will be a list", nargs="*", default=["a","b"])

args = parser.parse_args()
if args.verbose:
      print("verbosity turned on")

also:
group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group()
group.add_argument("-v", "--verbose", action="store_true")
group.add_argument("-q", "--quiet", action="store_true")

argc/argv example
-----------------

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    sys.exit('Usage: %s database-name' % sys.argv[0])

if not os.path.exists(sys.argv[1]):
    sys.exit('ERROR: Database %s was not found!' % sys.argv[1])

exiting from python
---------------------

sys.exit(0)

regular expression  regexp regex
------------------

import re
m =  re.search (pat, haystack)   # m is a match object or a None

m.group()  # gets the matched string
m.group(1)  # gets the 1st left paren group.

a = re.findall (pat, haystack)  # gets the list of all matches.. if he pat has (), then it gets back a list of tuples

a = re.sub(pat,replacement,src_string,count=0,flags=0)  # replace can use \1 to backref.

#remove invalid filename chars for windows
valid_filename = re.sub(r'[\\/:"*?<>|]+', "", var_having_junk_chars)

os-package (file manipulation stuff)
----------

os.path.join(dir,filename)
(dirname,filename) = os.path.split("abc/efg/file")
(filename,extension) = os.path.splitext("filename.ext")  # note the spelling split-ext
os.path.abspath(path)
os.path.realpath(path)  # resolves sym-links!
os.path.exists('path/to/file')
os.path.isdir('path/to/dir')
os.makedirs(path)   # no mkdir -p option.. just check isdir and then do this or do , catch except (latter better)
os.getcwd()         # get cwd pwd
os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))   # get dir of current file

import subprocess
subprocess.call(["ls","-l"])   # Just run it clobbering ur stdout with the cmd's stdout.
subprocess.check_output("ls -1")  # Run and get the o/p as return value

boolean_variable=os.access("/path/to/file",os.F_OK)  # does file exist at all
boolean_variable=os.access("/path/to/file",os.R_OK)
boolean_variable=os.access("/path/to/file",os.W_OK)
boolean_variable=os.access("/path/to/file",os.X_OK)

or

a=subprocess.Popen(["ls","-l"],stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
output=a.communicate()
a.wait()
print output[0]

# You can stack as many commands with a pipe arrangement.
# each command is one invocation to Popen, with its stdout/stderr set to the previous commands pipe.
# You can use subprocess.PIPE to ask popen to give you a pipe. THis is obtained by a call to communicate.
# the wait will wait till the command is done.
# The result of communicate is like a string, ready for processing.

import glob
list_of_filenames=glob.glob("*.py")

random
-------

random.seed([x])    # x is any hashanble object. if none is passed, sys-time is used.
random.shuffle(x)   # shuffles list x in place.
random.randint(a,b) # get a random int from [a,b], both included

time

Python Internals
---------------

Every name you see is a reference/pointer to an object.
The underlying object is either an immutable object or a mutable object.

Python library mgmt
--------------------

Typically python stores all its libraries in 

/usr/local/lib/python<ver>/site-packages
/usr/local/python<ver>/dist-packages

sudo apt-get install python-pip

and then

pip install <blah-blah>

or if u get the source

cd the-new-stuff
python ./setup.py install   # use the right python-version to install in its location
